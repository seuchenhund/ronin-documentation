description: A collection of 3rd party RPC node providers
---

Node providers handle the complexities of running full or archive nodes, including synchronization, storage, and uptime management, so developers and businesses can focus on building applications without the overhead of managing their own node infrastructure. Node providers offer secure and scalable access to the blockchain for querying data, broadcasting transactions or monitoring network events.
